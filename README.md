# BigTeX
A multi-file LaTeX project template

This project exists because I'm tired of getting stuck in multiple-tens-of-thousands-of-line Overleaf projects where no one has broken the primary source document into its respective sections, etc...

Working in such large files is exhausting.

I'm hoping, by having set this up once, I can reuse the directory structure of this document to simplify the writing process for other documents on which I work.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository, then build main.tex, e.g., `pdflatex main.tex`.

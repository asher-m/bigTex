    Why would someone want this?

    I'll tell you why: after too long of working on these multiple-tens-of-thousands-of-lines Overleaf projects where no one knows what's going on but everyone has to add their own contributions and writing to the project, I am a little fed up with the insanity of navigating our one shared source file.

    This is a project template that I (and maybe you!) can use in the future to organize what you're doing{\textemdash}uhhh{\textemdash}much more conveniently than in one huge file.

        \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../figures/intro/dog.jpg}
        \caption{An image of a dog.}
